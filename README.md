<h1>About this project </h3><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-green">

<p>
  This is the updated version of my <strong><a href="https://github.com/HenrikeStahlhut/capstone-project">final project</a></strong> for the web development bootcamp i did with <a href="https://www.neuefische.de/en">neuefische</a>. 
  <br/>
  Refactoring the whole project gave me new perspectives on my code, especially on the backend side. I also got to improve my components and how i want the features to work. In addition to the new features and upgrading to a responsive design, I worked with Typescript, Prisma and Postgres this time.

## Planned Features
Since the project is still in progress, here are some features I plan to implement in the near future:
- additional information for every plant, like  info about, watering, soil, light conditions etc.
- custom image for each plant
- working todos
  - adding todos to rooms/plants
  - watering and repotting schedules with a todo plan, so every plant gets the care it needs
  - reminders for your todos
